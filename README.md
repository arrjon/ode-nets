<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository is part of the bachelor thesis "Tiefe Neuronale Netze Mit Gew√∂hnlichen Differentialgleichungen" by Jonas Arruda, where the theoretical background of this code is discused.
Thus, this project provides an implementation of stable neuronal networks motivated by ordinary differential equations.

ODE-CNNs.ipynb: Implementation of the networks together with training and testing routines.

stability-regions.ipynb: Depiction of the stability regions of the ODE-solvers used as basis for the neural networks.

<!-- PACKAGES -->
## Packages and Datasets

The following packages are need to run the project:
* numpy
* matplotlib
* cv2
* tensorflow (2.0 or higher)
* tensorflow_datasets
* [Python utilities for reading the STL-10 dataset](https://github.com/mttk/STL10)

The following datasets are used:
* [CIFAR 10/100 (comes with tensorflow.keras.datasets)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
* [STL 10](https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/)
* [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset (comes with tensorflow_datasets)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/)
* [Berkeley DeepDrive](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu)

<!-- STRUCTURE -->
## Structure of the Code

* loading and normalzing the datasets
* implementation of different kinds of neural network layers (motivated by ODEs) and their regularization
* construction of the whole network as a Keras functional API model
* functions needed for training (i.e. weight decay, (Sparse-)IoU-Metric)
* various functions to generate pertubations (to test stability of the networks)
* routine to train a model (parameters depening on dataset)
* routine to test a model against pertubations
* routine to train and test all different kinds of networks for one given dataset

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage (of ODE-CNNs.ipynb)

First you have to specify the follwing parameters (if you want to run the script as it is):
* cycle = 1 # experiment number
* num_classes = 20 # defines the dataset used: 10=CIFAR10, 100=CIFAR100, '10b'=STL10, 3=Oxford IIIt Pet, 20=bdd100k
* train=True # boolean: whether you want to train all the different networks for a given dataset. If you want to train only a specific network, you have to change the run_train_test function.
* test_noise=False # boolean: whether you want to test the networks against noise. This function will load networks from the folder within the current cycle.
* test_adversarial_attack=False # boolean: whether you want to test the networks against an adversarial attack
* test_blur=False # boolean: whether you want to test the networks against blurring the images

The networks are saved in the path:
~gpu-tests/cylce %i/%s/ % (cycle, optimizer.__name__)

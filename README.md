<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository is part of the bachelor thesis "Tiefe Neuronale Netze Mit Gew√∂hnlichen Differentialgleichungen" by Jonas Arruda.


<!-- Packages -->
## Packages

The following packages are need to run the project:
* numpy
* matplotlib
* cv2
* tensorflow (2.0 or higher)
* tensorflow_datasets
* [Python utilities for reading the STL-10 dataset](https://github.com/mttk/STL10)

The following datasets need to be downloaded:
* [CIFAR 10/100 (comes with tensorflow.keras.datasets)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
* [STL 10](https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/)
* [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset (comes with tensorflow_datasets](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/)
* [Berkeley DeepDrive](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu)

## About The Project

This repository is part of the bachelor thesis "Tiefe Neuronale Netze Mit Gew√∂hnlichen Differentialgleichungen" by Jonas Arruda.
Thus, this project provides an implementation of stable neuronal networks motivated by ordinary differential equations.

ODE-CNNs.ipynb: Implementation of the networks together with training and testing routines.

stability-regions.ipynb: Depiction of the stability regions of the ODE-solvers used as basis for the neural networks.

<!-- Packages -->
## Packages

The following packages are need to run the project:
* numpy
* matplotlib
* cv2
* tensorflow (2.0 or higher)
* tensorflow_datasets
* [Python utilities for reading the STL-10 dataset](https://github.com/mttk/STL10)

The following datasets are used:
* [CIFAR 10/100 (comes with tensorflow.keras.datasets)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
* [STL 10](https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/)
* [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset (comes with tensorflow_datasets](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/)
* [Berkeley DeepDrive](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu)

<!-- Usage -->
## Usage

First you have to specify the follwing parameters:
* cycle = 1 # experiment number
* num_classes = 20 # number of classes: 10=CIFAR10, 100=CIFAR100, '10b'=STL10, 3=Oxford IIIt Pet, 20=bdd100k
* train=True # boolean: whether you want to train all the different networks for a given dataset. If you want to train only a specific network, you have to change the run_train_test function.
* test_noise=False # boolean: whether you want to test your networks against noise. This function will load networks from the folder within the current cycle.
* test_adversarial_attack=False # boolean: whether you want to test your networks against an adversarial attack
* test_blur=False # boolean: whether you want to test your networks against blurring the images
